# Two second set up

1. Install [node](http://nodejs.org)
2. From your terminal (or [command prompt](http://pcsupport.about.com/od/windows-8/a/command-prompt-windows-8.htm) if you're windows) and run these two commands:

```bash
npm install -g jsbin
jsbin
```

**Note:** You *may* have to run npm as the super user, so in that case, the first command would be, and you will be prompted for your password:

```bash
sudo npm install -g jsbin
```

*The end.*

...or read the [detailed guide on running JS Bin locally](/help/running-a-local-copy-of-jsbin) for more options and control over the setup.
