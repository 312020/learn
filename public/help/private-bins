#Private bins
  
Pro members may change the privacy settings for any bin they own, even those created before they became a pro.

Bins can be private to:

- their owner
- any team of which the owner is a member

All team members are pros.

Pro members don’t have to be in a team but they can join any number of teams.

## Leaving teams & downgrading

If you leave a team, bins you own which were private to the team:

- remain available to you
- are hidden from that team

If you downgrade from pro membership

- your private bins remain private
- you can make private bins public but you can’t go back
