How to change your password
===========================

Click on your avatar in the top right corner to open the account settings dropdown, from here you can enter your new password and click update. You'll be notified when it has completed.

As an extra precaution, you could log out and back in again to fully clear your session.

Note, if you log in using your Github account, you can still set a password, but that password is for JS Bin only, if you would like to change your github password please go to [github](https://github.com).
