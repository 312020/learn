# How do I set default code in all new bins?

By default, opening JS Bin, you'll be presented with a boilplate HTML document with no CSS and no JavaScript. But what if you want to *always* include code, like a default meta viewport?

Easy. **Save as template**, and note that you don't need to be logged in for this to work. Create a bin that represents how you want all your new bins to start out containing, then from the "Bins" menu, select "Save as template":

Perhaps you actually prefer a [super minimal boilerplate](http://jsbin.com/zunod/1/edit) and you could go further an predefine exactly which panels you want to see using the [account preferences](http://jsbin.com/account/preferences) (perhaps only the CSS & output panel for instance):

*Note that default preferences is currently only available to alpha testers, but will be released to all users once part of the stable release.*
