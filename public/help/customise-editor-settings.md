# How to customise the editor settings

Since JS Bin simply uses CodeMirror as the editor, naturally we expose that configuration to allow you to customise it yourself. Say if you donâ€™t like line wrapping, or prefer 8 character width tabs - you can change all this yourself.

Techniques used in this video:

* Browser console to change `jsbin.settings.editor`
* Enable debug mode using `jsbin.settings.debug = true`
