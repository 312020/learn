# How to customise the editor settings

*This article needs updating - as this is only required if you don't have a login.*

Since JS Bin simply uses CodeMirror as the editor, naturally we expose that configuration to allow you to customise it yourself. Say if you donâ€™t like line wrapping, or prefer 8 character width tabs - you can change all this yourself.

Techniques used in this video:

* Browser console to change `jsbin.settings.editor`
* Enable debug mode using `jsbin.settings.debug = true`
