# Welcome to learn.jsbin

This is the new home for information about jsbin, and where you can find out what's possible and perform particular tasks.

As this is still in it's infant stage, only a small number of articles have been posted, so we'll include the readme for the [project](https://github.com/jsbin-org/learn) below. If you want to contribute, all the source for this site is, as usual, on [github.com/jsbin-org/learn](https://github.com/jsbin-org/learn).

## The idea

The overall idea is to create a collection of articles, each focused on a particular task that some users might want to use JS Bin for.

These will be linked to from a page (possibly the homepage) with a grid of JS Bin features. Articles relevant to that feature should be listed next to the feature.

The whole site should be searchable.

## The plan

**Note:** Content should be being written throughout this.

- Finish off the single task template for mobile
- Add larger page styles for task page
- Finish feature list and build feature grid
- Add navigation to all articles (initially, a big list. This will be searchable later on)
- Search
- Add ask question box (maybe linked to search)
