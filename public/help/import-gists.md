# Importing Gists

Importing a [Gist](http://gist.github.com) is incredible easy. Simply change the `github` part of the URL to `jsbin` and JS Bin will import the gist into JS Bin for editing and rendering.

For example, changing [https://gist.github.com/remy/271333](https://gist.github.com/remy/271333) to [https://gist.jsbin.com/remy/271333](https://gist.jsbin.com/remy/271333) will import the JavaScript gist file in to the JavaScript panel and save the bin automatically for you.

If you're a bookmarklet user, here's one that you can use to simply click when you're on a gist to import to JS Bin: **<a href="javascript:(function()%7Bwindow.location='http://jsbin.com/gist'+window.location.pathname%7D)()">Import Gist</a>**.

You can also [export gists](/help/export-gist).
