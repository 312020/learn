# JS Bin design principles

These are emerging from the ongoing process of designing and building JS Bin. They’re a work in progress.

- ** Visitors to jsbin.com get a cursor**  
  Nothing obscures the tool – users just start typing to begin a bin.
- **Support learning**
- **Streaming by default**
- **Anonymous first**  
  Avoid requiring login
- **Open first**  
  Design and development happens in public, unless there’s a good reason to go private.
- **Respect ex-users**  
  Don’t break links to their stuff.
  Never make public things they set as private.
