# What a Pro can expect

If you've upgraded to pro, or if you're curious, then thank you and here's the skinny.

## What do Pro get you?

The Pro user status does two important things:

1. Access to pro features (duh, obviously)
2. Helps sustain JS Bin as a project so it can continue to be free and open source for education

This second point is *really* important to us. JS Bin has existed for over 5 years with no income, running on hefty servers and thousands of development hours poured into it simply because knowing it was being used to teach others was motivation enough.

Eventually we decided that to spend fully time on JS Bin, and to invest fully in it's infrastructure, JS Bin needed to sustain itself, hence Pro status.

## Pro features

At time of writing, our pro feature set is:

- [Private bins](#privatebins)
- Vanity URLs
- SSL option for all of JS Bin
- Dropbox integration
- Priority support
- "Sandbox" mode

## Private bins

Self explanatory, but it means if any other user than you tries to access your private bin, they will get a 404.

Once your bin is private, you'll also see the card in the bottom right indicating it's privacy mode.

## Vanity URLs

Vanity URLs has two purposes. The first is that puts *your* username when you share your bin.
