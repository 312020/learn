# Why register?

Registration is free and very simple with JS Bin, but what are the benefits?

## 1. Bin history

All the bins you create whilst logged in can be retrieved from the "File", "Open" menu item.

## 2. Save customisations

From the "Account" menu, you can [customise your editor settings](/blog/twdtw-8-svg-settings#usersettingslive) and this will be saved against your account, and not just to that particular machine.

There's a number of specifics you can customise: plugins enabled in the main editor, key bindings (such as vim or sublime), default panels shown when arriving at JS Bin, JSHint defaults and more.

## 3. Shortcut URLs

The last bin you worked on is always easily available under **/&lt;user&gt;/last**, and can be used with all modifiers. For example, if your username is *dave*, then all these work:

- Last bin: http://jsbin.com/dave/last
- Edit last bin: http://jsbin.com/dave/last/edit
- Share codecasting for last bin: http://jsbin.com/dave/last/watch

You can also refer to the nth from last too using `/last-n`:

- Penulatimate bin: http://jsbin.com/dave/last-1/edit

This is also particularly handy if you want to quickly fire up your current bin on a mobile device - just bookmark your shortcut URL!
