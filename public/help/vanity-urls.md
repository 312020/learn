# Vanity URLs

Vanity URLs has two purposes. The first is that puts *your* username when you share your bin's output, and secondly allows you to publish to your vanity homepage.

This means you can publish any bin to your vanity url on `<you>.jsbin.com` for example: [http://dave.jsbin.com](http://dave.jsbin.com)

In addition, when you share the full output of your bins, your username is included in the URL, such as [http://dave.jsbin.com/fajac/3/](http://dave.jsbin.com/fajac/3/)
