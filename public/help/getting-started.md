# Getting started with JS Bin

JS Bin is a tool for experimenting with web languages. In particular HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but JS Bin also supports other languages too (like Markdown, Jade and Sass).

There's many features tucked away inside JS Bin, but our design principle is that **everyone gets a cursor**. So when you arrive for the first time, you'll be greeted with an initial start HTML page and very little else (though you [can customise your default code](/help/defaults-in-bins)).

*As soon as you start typing* your code is saved, and you'll be given a URL. We even try our best to make them [pronounceable](/help/pronounceable-urls)! You've created your first *bin*. A bin is the name we refer to the thing you've saved on JS Bin.

## Sharing

Now you can share this URL with anyone else. There's a few ways to view that bin too if you click "Share" and select the configuration and URL you want to share:
