# What is JS Bin?

JS Bin is a tool that *enables* the education and learning web technologies. 

There's a mass of features packed inside of JS Bin, but our aim is to be part of your tool chain to help you solve problems, explore technology and teach others.

Here's an analogy to help:

> If you wanted to build the coolest, fastest, power hungry car in the world, or perhaps teach a group of students how an engine works or show how aerodynamics are applied to car design, then *JS Bin is the garage full of all the tools you need to do your job*.

JS Bin's motto is *"Hack. Learn. Fix. Teach"*, and JS Bin is a vehicle to achieve all of these things.

* **Hack** — JS Bin lets you experiment with the full source code in a throw-away environment.
* **Learn** — JS Bin lets you view *and* watch other people's code, to see exactly how code affects the output instantly in real-time.
* **Fix** — JS Bin is perfect as a [pastebin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin) to create isolated problems to help diagnose and debug problems, either yourself, or by sharing the bin with others.
* **Teach** — Using tools like [CodeCasting](/help/what-is-codecasting), [embedding](http://localhost:9000/help/how-can-i-embed-jsbin) you can share your knowledge and help others with your experience, and by sharing that code, they can go on an experiment directly with your code and see real-time feedback in the output window.
