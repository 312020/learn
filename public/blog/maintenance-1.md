# Maintenance

These past three weeks we have been mainly working on bug fixes and internal maintenance, so no big announcement except that we have released to 100% of our users the [settings and preferences pages](/blog/twdtw-8-svg-settings#usersettingslive). Go and have fun with it!

## The small things that matter

The general maintenance involved changing the top menu label from "Bins" to "File" (there will be a post about it to illustrate why we changed it), updating and fixing [gist import](/help/import-gists) and adding a shortcut to archive bins (check the updated [help page](http://jsbin.com/help/keyboard-shortcuts) to see all the shortcuts available in JS Bin).

## Spread your love

We love when our users help us improving JS Bin by raising [issues](https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/issues), bugs and requests, and we love it even more when they tell us and the world why and what they love about JS Bin.

## Totally aside

We like the classics and we like geeky strange ideas, so what's better than a new Star Wars inedited cut?
