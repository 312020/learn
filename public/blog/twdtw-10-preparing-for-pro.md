# TWDTW #10 - Preparing for Pro

We've been getting closer and closer to releasing JS Bin Pro, grappling with the last 5% of the work. But we're real close, so here's what to expect.

## Surfacing features



## Legals in place

Any terms of service or privacy policy has been missing from JS Bin for a long time (just because it was a side project), so I've painstakingly contracted a lawyer and had these docs drawn up *and* attempted to translate them in to human speak.

## Pro features ready

- Vanity URLs for your published bins and a vanity homepage
- Dropbox sync
- Private bins
- Access to beta flagged features

Coming soon features

- Asset upload (pro)
- Secret bins (pro)
- Unlimited collaborative (pro)
- SCSS and Sass (both with Compass and Bourbon support)
