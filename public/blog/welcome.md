# Welcome to the new learning site

Welcome to the new learning site for JS Bin. The aim of the site is to provide a central resource for learning how to use JS Bin, learning from videos, discovering tricks, reading about how JS Bin is built (and how you might be able to re-use technology and ideas) and share upcoming features via this new blog.

## What's new?

We've been working hard in the last few months to introduce pro user accounts to the site along with a few additional features for everyone else.

### Why pro?

As you know (or maybe are discovering), JS Bin is an open source project, [freely available on github](http://github.com/jsbin/jsbin).

However, it's been a side project of mine for the last 5 years, and I wanted to really invest my time properly into the project, to support the school, univercities and companies using JS Bin to freely provide education. So the project needs to become sustainable. This is where pro accounts come in.
