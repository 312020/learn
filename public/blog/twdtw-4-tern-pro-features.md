# TWDTW #4 - Tern is live

We've now released Tern to live for everyone, and we've been hard at work on our Pro features and working on improving the JS Bin core code.

## Tern

A few weeks ago we showed off the [demo of Tern](/blog/twdtw-1-sass-tern-security#tern), and now it's live. You need to manually turn it on via the `addons`:

```js
jsbin.settings.addons.tern = true;
```

...then refresh and Turn is enabled in the JavaScript panel.

## Upcoming Pro features

We're all working hard on Pro features for JS Bin (whilst also pushing out more and more features for *all* users), but here's the headline for day one:

- Vanity URLs (and support for your own domain)
- Dropbox link (for bin saving and asset hosting)
- Private bins
- Super amazing Pro bad-ass badge (actually just a bit of CSS around your avatar, but still!)
- API write access

And Pro will also include:

- Unlimited code casting functionality
- Unlimited live reload (with full output)

Most importantly, Pro will support JS Bin continuing to be open source and free for education.
