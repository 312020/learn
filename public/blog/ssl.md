# SSL: A secure login

Up until now all of JS Bin has been served over standard HTTP. This is fine for most of the site, however we've decided to upgrade
the login and register (and eventually the account settings) pages to use SSL (i.e. encrypted data transmission).

This means your email and password are always sent over a secure connection, keeping those details safe. 

If you're already logged into JS Bin you'll notice that the next time you visit you'll recieve a message and be prompted to sign in again, just the once, using the newer, SSL login.

If you have any questions, or find any problems with the process, [please submit an issue on github](http://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/issues/new?title=Problem%20with%20new%20SSL%20Login).
