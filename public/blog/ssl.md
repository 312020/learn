# A more secure login

Up until now all of JS Bin has been served over standard http. This is fine (and necessary) for most of the site, however we've decided to upgrade
the login and register pages to use SSL (an encrypted data transmission). 

This means your email and password are always sent over a secure connection, keeping those details safe. 
If you're already logged into jsbin you'll notice that the next time you visit you'll recieve a message and be prompted to sign
in again using the newer, secure login.

If you find or have any problems with the newer login, please submit an issue on [github](http://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/issues/new?title=Problem%20with%20new%20SSL%20Login&body=Please%20provide%20additional%20details%20here:)

## Why don't we use SSL for the whole of JS Bin ?
