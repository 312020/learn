# A tiny tweak, measured

This is a post about how I made a proposal for a small UI change, created a hypothesis, set the success criteria and how we measured it's success at the technical level.

I proposed some time ago that we change "Bins" in the top menu bar, to "File" suggesting that more visitors would click the menu. 

The way we've normally done things is: if it *sounds right* it can go live. Except this time I wanted to use our feature flags to *test* whether it was the right change to make.
