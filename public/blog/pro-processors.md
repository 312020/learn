# Announcements: Pro & Processors

The last few weeks we've all been busy on that last stretch of work, that last 5% of work that always eeks itself out to be longer than you expect.

But now, we're live and two huge updates for you: Pro and processors.

## Pro

We've been working on Pro accounts for the last 6 months (amongst a lot of other work) and our initial offering is now live.

To upgrade to pro, first you'll need a free account, then head to the [upgrade page](http://jsbin.com/upgrade). Pro accounts are available monthly or yearly subscriptions currently offering 2 months free.

By upgrading to Pro accounts, your contribution helps support JS Bin as a continued open source project. Plus, you'll have access to [private bins](/help/private-bins), [dropbox support](/help/dropbox), vanity URLs and [more](/help/pro).

## Processors

The biggest news is that Sass & SCSS both with Compass and Bourbon support has landed. Also, we've restored Stylus, updated LESS and added [Myth](http://www.myth.io/) to the CSS processors. Full specifics on [versions](/help/versions) are also available.

In keeping with JS Bin being open source, our processor server is also open source, found under [Pennyworth](https://github.com/jsbin/pennyworth).

You can use Pennyworth for your own project if you want "Processors as a Service", or perhaps extend it to be a CLI tool, or a sublime plugin? It's online, documented and available under [MIT](http://jsbin.mit-license.org).

So for forth and hack, learn, fix and teach!

## Totally aside

With all the seriousness aside, you got to take a break, and frankly, this video sours into amazing at 2m49s! Enjoy. This guy is a genius.
