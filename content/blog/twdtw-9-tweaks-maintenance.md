These past three weeks we have been mainly working on bug fixes and internal maintenance, so no big announcement except that we have released to 100% of our users the [settings and preferences pages](/blog/twdtw-8-svg-settings#usersettingslive). Go and have fun with it!

## The small things that matter

We're often releasing multiple times throughout the week with small bug fixes and tweaks, a few that you might have noticed:

- Github changed their URL format for gists, so we fixed [gist import](/help/import-gists) (which was broken for a short time) [#1507](https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/pull/1507)
- Logged in users can archive using keyboard shortcut <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Y</kbd> [#1000](https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/issues/1000)
- All the [JS Bin keyboard shortcuts](/help/keyboard-shortcuts) are documented in detail
- We changed "Bins" to "File" in the top menu [#1414](https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/issues/1414) (more on why in a later post)

## Spread your love

We love when you help us improving JS Bin by raising [issues](https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/issues), bugs and pull requests, and we love it just as much when you tell us that you love JS Bin:

> [Why I Love JS Bin](http://www.jimmylauzau.com/blog/2014/05/28/why-i-love-js-bin/) by Jimmy Lauzau [@jimmay5469](http://twitter.com/jimmay5469)

Where Jimmy talks about using the Ember branded version of JS Bin, his preferences and default templates.

## Totally aside

We like the classics and we like geeky strange ideas, so what's better than Star Wars, re-edited in alphabetical order..?
