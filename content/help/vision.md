- hacking (the person who would use jsbin to hack a prototype, and sharing their work)
- learning to code (like a student, or in a classroom environment)
- fix jsbin (to make it better, add libraries, advanced users and comfortable with code)
- teaching (how jsbin can help in a classroom, in a group environment, in a published tutorial sense)
