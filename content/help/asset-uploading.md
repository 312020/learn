# Asset uploading

Available to [pro only](/upload). Simply drag & drop your assets into JS Bin and it'll upload instantly and insert an image tag with your newly uploaded asset.

Each pro user can host up to 1GB of assets - so that gives you a bit of freedom to sling up your images as quickly as you create bins.

To manage your assets, head over to the [assets](/account/assets) account page and you can delete files and check your usage.

## Uploading non-image assets

Navigate to the [assets](/account/assets) page and drag the file directly in to the browser window. This asset (such as a CSS file) can be now re-used inside of your bins.

## Demo

You can see a demo of upload in action below:
