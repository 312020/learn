If you try to register with Github and your Github username is already taken in JS Bin, then you'll need to follow these steps to use Github sign in.

## 1. Check that you've not already registered

It's entirely possible you registered with JS Bin some time ago (we started taking sign ups back in 2011). So try a [password reminder](http://jsbin.com/login) with your username entered. Simply enter your username and select "I've forgotten my password".

If the password reset request is successful, you'll receive an email with a link that will sign in you to allow you to reset your password.

Next skip to step 3.

## 2. Register with JS Bin using email

Since your preferred username is taken, you'll need to [register](https://jsbin.com/register) with JS Bin and select a username. 

Now you have an account, you can link it to your Github account so you can use Github sign in forever-more.

## 3. Link your Github account

From the account link in the menu bar, select [Update profile](https://jsbin.com/account/profile):

Then from your account, follow the **[Use Github for logging in](https://jsbin.com/auth/github)** link. Once your account is linked, you will be able to use Github for sign in.
