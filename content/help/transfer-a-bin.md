# Transferring ownership of a bin

If you own a bin and you want to transfer ownership, from the "bin info" card in the bottom right of JS Bin, expand it and click the "transfer" link:

![Transfer bin](/images/transfer.png)

You'll be prompted for the username that you want to transfer to, and if successful, the bin will reload with a notification confirming that the bin now has a new owner.

## Limitations

This process is currently limited to a single snapshot of a bin at a time, and bulk transfers are not currently supported.
