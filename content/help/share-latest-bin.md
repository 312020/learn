Simple. There's a few ways depending on what you want to achieve.

## Method 1: remove the revision from the URL

So instead of sharing http://jsbin.com/fajac/3, you share http://jsbin.com/fajac. You can also add on `/edit` if you want to always share the latest edit view.

## Method 2: use "latest" instead of the revision

Just swapping the revision for the word `latest` in the URL will redirect to the latest revision (so your visitor will be able to see the revision number after the redirect): http://jsbin.com/fajac/latest

Again, you can add the `/edit` modifier to the URL if you want the edit view.

## Bonus: point to *your* last bin

A bonus of having a free account, [amongst others](/help/why-register), is that you can also share *your* latest bin by putting your username in the URL: http://jsbin.com/dave/last
