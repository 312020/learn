Only aggregated, anonymised data is periodically transmitted to external services to help us improve the JS Bin Website and service.

Feel free to check out their own Privacy Policies to find out more.</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Analytics: anonymous (ad serving domains, browser type, demographics, language settings, page views, time/date), pseudonymous (IP address)</li>
<li>Librato: numbers of types of requests and time taken to complete transactions</li>

We may need to share personal information with our Agents in order to provide products or services to you.

In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy. If you have a registered account, we will strive to allow you to download your complete history of Bins as HTML files.</p>
