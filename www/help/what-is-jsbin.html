<p>JS Bin is a tool that <em>enables</em> you to learn, experiment and teach using web technologies.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a mass of features packed inside of JS Bin, but our aim is to be part of your tool chain to help you solve problems, explore technology and teach others.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an analogy to help:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you wanted to build the coolest, fastest, power hungry car in the world, or perhaps teach a group of students how an engine works or show how aerodynamics are applied to car design, then <em>JS Bin is the garage full of all the tools you need to do your job</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>JS Bin&#39;s motto is <em>&quot;Hack. Learn. Fix. Teach&quot;</em>, and JS Bin is a vehicle to achieve all of these things, and it&#39;s likely your use will fall in to one or more of these categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hack</strong> — JS Bin lets you experiment with the full source code in a throw-away environment.</li>
<li><strong>Learn</strong> — JS Bin lets you view <em>and</em> watch other people&#39;s code, to see exactly how code affects the output instantly in real-time.</li>
<li><strong>Fix</strong> — JS Bin is perfect as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastebin">pastebin</a> to create isolated problems to help diagnose and debug problems, either yourself, or by sharing the bin with others.</li>
<li><strong>Teach</strong> — Using tools like <a href="/help/what-is-codecasting">CodeCasting</a>, <a href="/help/how-can-i-embed-jsbin">embedding</a> you can share your knowledge and help others with your experience, and by sharing that code, they can go on an experiment directly with your code and see real-time feedback in the output window.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="inplainenglish">In plain English</h2>
<p>JS Bin is a code sharing site. Along with the code, the complete <em>output</em> of the code is also be shared. As a user types in the editor &quot;panels&quot;, they will see the output being generated in real-time in the output panel.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a few common use cases for JS Bin. The first is teaching. Teachers will use JS Bin as a platform for showing how web languages work (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, but also languages that generate these, such as CoffeeScript, LESS and Markdown).</p>
<p>Students need only to use a browser to start creating web pages and seeing the direct effect of their code on the output.</p>
<p>Teachers can also use JS Bin&#39;s CodeCasting functionality. This is where the teacher will code in JS Bin, and share a unique URL with their students, and upon visiting the URL, the student&#39;s instance of JS Bin will update in real-time with the teacher&#39;s code and output - also allowing for remote teaching or remote tutorials.</p>
<p>The second use case is in replicating bugs. Developers will use JS Bin to isolate and replicate bugs that demonstrates a particular problem. Then share the URL to the JS Bin either as the full output or the editor view of JS Bin.</p>
<p>Once this is shared, a good member of the web community can fix the code (which is saved to a new URL) and share that back with the original author.</p>
