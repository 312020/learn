<p>Currently only the login, register and (upcoming) account settings are served over SSL. The rest of JS Bin is not.</p>
<p>This is ultimately because JS Bin uses <code>iframe</code>s to render your code&#39;s preview, and any <code>iframe</code> served over HTTPS cannot serve resources from HTTP.</p>
<p>This means if you include a library or an image that&#39;s being served over HTTP, the live preview will <em>block</em> that resource. It might be JavaScript that the rest of your code relies on, in which case your code will break.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>We did actually do a ton of work to get JS Bin <a href="https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/pull/673">working entirely over SSL</a> back in mid 2013, and it even got released...for a few minutes.</p>
<p>It was quickly reversed out because we spotted (and remembered) that the <code>iframe</code> was blocking the content. Some CDNs would support HTTPS for their scripts, but there&#39;s many, many bins out in the wild, and they would instantly break due to the non-HTTPS resources being blocked - which is unacceptable and against our <a href="/help/design-principles">design principles</a>.</p>
<p>So SSL for <em>all of JS Bin</em> was removed and later replaced with SSL for specific pages.</p>
<h2 id="enablingsslforallofjsbin">Enabling SSL for all of JS Bin</h2>
<p>Those users with pro accounts can enable SSL across all of JS Bin via <a href="http://jsbin.com/account/preferences">their preferences</a>. Note that extra care in including resources is needed, and to ensure they work, it&#39;s recommended you use <a href="http://www.paulirish.com/2010/the-protocol-relative-url/">protocol relative</a> URLs.</p>
<p>Once this is enabled, visiting jsbin.com will redirect to https. However, not all JS Bin URLs will redirect. The following rules apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sharing your own bins will be on https by default and visitors will also view those bins on https</li>
<li>Visiting the JS Bin editor will <em>always</em> redirect to https</li>
<li>You <em>can</em> share non-https URLs, but you need to change these manually</li>
<li>Viewing another user&#39;s bins can be on http and will not redirect to https</li>
<li>You <em>can</em> view another user&#39;s bin under https</li>
<li>Other user&#39;s can&#39;t view their bins under https (if they haven&#39;t enabled the pro option)</li>
<li>Embedded bins will maintain their protocol of their author</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="sslsupportintheopensourceproject">SSL support in the open source project</h2>
<p>Even though the <a href="https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin">open source repository</a> has some hints of SSL support inside it, we don&#39;t actively support using SSL in local installations. This is mainly due to the bespoke set up with domains and SSL certificates we use in production, so we prefer a simpler local install.</p>
<p>SSL is provided through our proxy server using <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Main">nginx</a> and there is some interest to explore <a href="https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/issues/1168">further SSL support</a> so please do get in touch if you have any success in this area.</p>
